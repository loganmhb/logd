  "Implements logic for the Raft algorithm.

  The design is intended to keep as much logic as possible in pure
  functions and make the system as easy to reason about and test as
  possible. In order to achieve those ends, all interactions with the
  outside world occur by processing events arriving in a stream,
  including timeouts and RPC calls. The request-response style RPCs
  that Raft assumes are replaced with asynchronous RPCs that deliver
  their results as events in the global stream.

  Responses to events are implemented as pure functions that take the
  system state and the event and return an updated state and a list of
  side actions to be executed -- reset timeouts, make or respond to
  RPC calls, etc. A thin imperative wrapper around these pure
  functions handles actually executing the actions (asynchronously)
  and tracking timeouts.

  This pervasive asynchrony requires a little extra bookkeeping for
  outstanding requests and extra information attached to RPC calls to
  maintain Raft's guarantees, but pays off in testability and
  transparency. Since events are all processed on a single stream,
  capturing and simulating state transitions is simple compared to a
  synchronous, parallel model, but the performance benefits of
  performing network I/O (the probable bottleneck) are retained."

  "Structure describing the state of the Raft system, given a list of

  The Raft protocol specifies a log of changes applied to a state
  machine, but since the desired state here is a log no actual state
  machine is necessary, only the log itself so :last-applied is
  omitted.

  There's some additional book keeping over and above what's specified
  in the Raft paper here because the paper assumes synchronous RPC
  calls updating mutable state, while we use asynchronous RPC calls
  that result in response events. The upshot of that is 1)
  AppendEntries responses need to include the index they're responding
  to, and 2) we need to keep track of which peers we've sent requests to
  already."
